              It is mandatory for the authors to write and prepare their
              manuscripts according to the instructions and specifications
              listed below. The length and effectiveness of the peer review

              preparing their manuscripts. Therefore, contributors are strongly
              encouraged to read these instructions carefully before preparing a
              manuscript for submission and to check the manuscript for
              conformance before submitting it for publication.

              Free access publishing proposes a relatively new model for
              scholarly journal publishing that provides immediate, worldwide,
              barrier-free access to the full-text of all published articles.
              Open access allows all interested readers to view, download,
              print, and redistribute any article without a subscription,
              enabling far greater distribution of an author's work than the
              traditional subscription-based publishing model. Many authors in a
              variety of fields have begun to realize the benefits that open
              access publishing can provide in terms of increasing the impact of
              their work.

              from an author's research budget, or by their supporting
              institution, in the form of Article Processing Charges. These
              Article Processing Charges replace subscription charges and allow
              publishers to make the full-text of every published article freely
              available to all interested readers. In addition, authors who

              Egyptian Journal of Chemistry is a free Access journal. Publishing
              an article in Journal of Chemistry requires Article Processing
              Charges that will be billed to the submitting author following the
              acceptance of an article for publication. Apart from these Article
              Process Charges, there are no submission charges, page charges, or
              color charges. The fees to be paid following the acceptance of an
              article are indicated in the table below:
